I am currently a Master's student at the School of Integrated Technology at [Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)](https://www.gist.ac.kr/), where I am advised by Professor [Kyoobin Lee](https://ailab.gist.ac.kr/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from Inha University in 2020.

My interests are robotics and artificial intelligence. The goal of my research is to enable systems to interact with people and the environment in an intelligent way. In order for the robot to operate stably in an unstructured environment, I believe that perception is an important thing in robot manipulation. So I focus on this and will struggle with the technology that robots could perceive through efficient interaction.
